                <p>My dearest <span id="name">Evan</span>，</p>
                <p>❤️Happy Valentine’s Day!❤️</p>
                <p>I love you and miss you so much. Every second, I think about our previous meetings and look forward to the next time we’re together.</p>
                <p>Your apartment has become my favorite place—it’s filled with freedom, comfort, and love. Every minute we shared together were amazing. I love the feeling when we hug, touch, whishper, cuddle, and nuzzle. One of my favorite moments during our last visit was when you came back to kiss me goodbye in the morning. Another was when we took turns lying on each other’s laps, caressing each other’s heads—it felt so comforting and intimate 😇. And of course, our sex is always wonderful. I had planned to surprise you with heart-shaped blooms, get dressed up, and whisper, “Let’s have an early Valentine’s Day,”🫣 but my shyness got the better of me. Still, I loved how you made me feel with your hand. I hope you’ll always let me know if anything ever feels uncomfortable for you. I never want you to feel pain. Next time, I hope we can try something new and more dirty talks. 🫦</p>
                <p>The sweeter the memories, the lonelier I feel when we’re apart. 😿 Sometimes, I feel a little sad when I notice how different things are between us now compared to the early days in Guangzhou. Back then, we texted a lot, gave each other 100% attention, and even shared the same screen while using our phones. You’d look at me, forget everything else, and reply to my messages with so much enthusiasm—it was so sweet, and I wish that passion could last forever. I hope we can find a way to bring that closeness back, even when we’re apart. 💗</p>
                <p>I’ve always wanted to feel well cared for and treated romantically, as I mentioned at the very beginning. I don’t expect you to be a mind reader, but what I want most is for you to think a little more about what might make me happy and genuinely want to give those things to me. I know you can’t always guess what I need, but I’d love it if you could try to understand my needs and surprise me sometimes. Things feel so much more special when they come from your own initiative, rather than me always having to ask. Even small, thoughtful gestures would make a big difference and make me feel truly cherished. Here are some ideas that would make me happy. These aren’t things you must do, but rather a reference for when you want to do something special or inspiration when you’re in the right situation. I hope they work for you too, so we can share the happiness together. ❤️</p>
                <p>     > Prioritizing me and devoting a little more time to me each day.</p>
                <p>     > Showing more concern and encouraging me when I’m feeling down.</p>
                <p>     > Texting me when you get home after work, so I can feel your presence as soon as I wake up..</p>
                <p>     > Random audio or video messages with something cute or flirty.</p>
                <p>     > “I saw/heard this [insert thing] and thought of you,” then sharing it with me.</p>
                <p>     > Telling me you talked or bragged about me to your friends or family.</p>
                <p>     > Creating more quality time together through online activities.</p>
                <p>     > Practicing or learning one of my hobbies and interests—or teaching me something about yours.</p>

                <p>I also want you to call me by a special name more often, like “bb,” “babe,” or “Ruby.” “Hey” feels a bit impersonal, and I want to feel uniquely yours. Another thing I’ve been thinking about: I’d love it if you’d ask me for help with things, no matter how small or big. 🥺 I want to feel needed and involved in your life, even in the little moments. I remember noticing you using your mouth to roll up your sleeves during a video call, and while I know it’s not a big deal to you, I’d love to help with those small tasks. It’s my way of showing I care.</p>
                <p>I want you to know that I’m happy to see how easily satisfied you are with just having me in your life. I’m also really thankful to see you’ve been more focused during our video calls since I mentioned it and that you’ve started sharing more details about your life and work. I honestly appreciate your efforts 💕. Still, I would suggest thinking more deeply and detailedly about what you truly want in a relationship—what your ideal relationship looks like, how you’d like to be treated, and what concrete actions you’d like to take for your partner, how much you think you understand me, and how you imagine I’d react in certain situations, and whether that’s acceptable to you. I’d love for you to think about these things and share them with me someday, whether in a letter 💌. Knowing our needs and being open is the key to helping us understand if we’re truly compatible and guiding us in building a stronger connection.</p>

                <p>I know nothing can be perfect, and these things might feel unfamiliar to you. I also know I’m not always great at speaking up about my feelings and needs in the moment, and I sometimes get down when I’m not 100% good. I tend to wait and calm down, though I might sometimes become a bit passive-aggressive. Then, I look for references from others to see if it’s an actual issue or just overthinking 😶‍🌫️. When I come across perfect examples or extreme advice, it can make me feel jealous or upset, but I know we’re not facing an unsolvable problem. I believe in us and am working on it from my side to make things better for both of us. I know you’ll do the same, and I’m grateful that we’re both growing and learning together. 🫶</p>

                <p>The long distance relationship always requires more efforts and patience than others. I need to feel more confident about moving forward together—both mentally and physically. If things go well this year, I’d like to move to the US as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’ll focus more on myself 🧘‍♀️ —learning, reading, exercising, and exploring the world outside when we can’t be together online. I’ll also keep an eye out for opportunities. The easiest option I know of right now is joining an intern project with a J1 visa through an agency. There might not be a suitable position in your city, but it would still shorten the distance between us significantly. I’m excited about the possibility of being closer to you and building our future together. I deeply believe in our love and hope that we’ll find a way to work out. 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨</p>
                <p>I want you to know how much I appreciate you and the efforts you’ve made to make our relationship work. Your love means the world to me, and I’m so grateful to have you in my life.</p>
                <p>Wishing you all the happiness in the world.</p>
                <p>I LOVE YOU. ❤️</p>
                <p>Yours <span id="your-name">Ruby</span></p>
